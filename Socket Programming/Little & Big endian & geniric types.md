MSB - Most Significant Bit - which contributes the highest value in binary number
LSB - Least sig bit - vice versa

Bit Positions (MSB → LSB):   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
Bit Weights (MSB → LSB):   128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1

MSB → LSB: 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
LSB → MSB: 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 (just reverse order)

# Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory.

Big endian - (big end first) systems which store msb at first (usual way of storing)
little endian - (little end first) - vice versa (Most modern PCs (x86, x86_64 CPUs))

# Generic Types
it means a common structure that uses to speciy multiple types, like a base format
