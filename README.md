## Introduction

This repository aims to provide beginners with a practical approach to learning the C programming language. It covers various topics and concepts, including data types, control statements, functions, arrays, pointers, and more.

Each topic contains code examples and exercises that allow you to practice and reinforce your understanding of the concepts. The examples are provided in the form of individual C files, making it easy to navigate and learn.

## Prerequisites

To run the code examples in this repository, you'll need:

- A C compiler such as GCC or Clang
- Basic knowledge of the C programming language

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/prakash02100/programming_c.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd programming_c
   ```

3. Compile the individual C files using a C compiler:

   ```shell
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ```

   Replace `filename.c` with the name of the C file you want to compile, and `filename` with the desired output executable name.

## Usage

To run a compiled C program, execute the corresponding executable file. For example, if you have compiled a file named `example.c` into an executable named `example`, run the following command:

```shell
./example
```

## Examples

The repository contains a variety of C programming examples, covering different topics and concepts. Some of the example files you'll find include:

- `hello_world.c`: A simple "Hello, World!" program.
- `variables.c`: Examples demonstrating the usage of variables and data types.
- `control_statements.c`: Examples of control statements such as if-else, switch-case, and loops.
- `functions.c`: Illustrations of defining and using functions in C.
- `arrays.c`: Examples showcasing arrays and their manipulation.
- `pointers.c`: Demonstrations of pointer variables and their applications.

Feel free to explore the repository and try out the examples to deepen your understanding of C programming.
